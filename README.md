# PROD225-Assignment-1
First Assignment for PROD225 (C++ Game Design)


This was a project I was really proud of, I think the class hierachy had a couple hitches in it that I wanted to fix but didn't get to in time but other than
that I think it was some of my best work at the time.

It is a command line interface game where the player plays a rogue like dungeoun crawler where they explore the dungeon till they find the exit.

The key goals of this project were solid Garbage collection and class hierachy.
